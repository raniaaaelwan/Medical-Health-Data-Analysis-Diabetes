# 🩺 Medical & Health Data Analysis – "Diabetes"

Proudly presented by **Team Sugar Bytes 💗**

An end-to-end **Data Analytics & Visualization project** exploring how lifestyle, income, and education influence long-term health and diabetes risk.  
Our team transformed raw medical data into meaningful insights, revealing patterns that shape public health outcomes ✨.

## 📊 Project Overview

The **“Diabetes Data Analysis”** project uncovers how daily habits and social factors impact the likelihood of developing diabetes.  
Through data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization — we turned complex datasets into clear, data-driven stories that help understand the connections between lifestyle and health.

We also built an **AI-powered chatbot 🤖** that allows users to interact with the dataset, ask analytical questions, and receive real-time visual and data-based insights.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore relationships between lifestyle, nutrition, and diabetes risk.  
- Identify correlations between income, education level, and health outcomes.  
- Use data visualization to communicate key medical and social findings.  
- Build an AI chatbot to make insights interactive and accessible.  
- Strengthen teamwork and creative problem-solving through real-world data.

## 🧩 Project Workflow

Our journey started with **data cleaning and preprocessing**, handling missing values and inconsistencies.  
Then, we conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to find hidden trends and correlations.  
Afterward, we created **interactive visualizations** using Power BI and Python to communicate insights effectively.  
Finally, we integrated an **AI chatbot** that enables users to query the data directly and receive visual responses in real time.  
The project concluded with a **presentation** that told a complete story — from raw data to actionable insights.
